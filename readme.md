### A simple tool to help build responsive websites

This is a simple tool to help developers convert fixed pixel widths to percentages. A use-case would be, being handed a typical desktop-sized design, but being told it should be responsive and fluid. Put in the widths of the main columns into the app and get back the percentages.

## Notes

* It's fully responsive, naturally.
* I've added crude timestamps onto the CSS and JS refrences for cache busting. Better techniques welcome.
* Only needs to support good browsers. I'm not bothered about IE, I'm sure developers won't be IE users anyway.

## Todo

* Clean up (hasitlly written) JavaScript
* Account for guttering
